All three links lead to exactly the same version of the tool.\nThe MAPS tool has been optimised for screen sizes typically found with desktop and laptop devices, rather than smaller mobile devices. Using smaller devices is possible, but will not provide the intended user experience of the interfaces. The tool will work in widely used commercial operating systems and web browsers (as at 2024).\nAccess is free of charge and does not require users to log-in. Users of the full scope of functionality, i.e. the cost & effectiveness modelling, and/or bring-your-own data, may prefer to create a user account in order to save for a later date their own input data and models.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe current version of the tool is , and returning users may need to check a locally cached earlier version is not being used. If this is the case, follow your browser instructions to clear the cache and refresh your version of the MAPS tool.",

All key datasests (FCT, FBS, HCES datasets etc.) are described using a polygonal coverage area which is utilized by the tool when deciding which datasets to combine for a given output.\nThough the initial focus of the MAPS tool is Sub Saharan Africa, this flexible data model would allow a version of the tool to support datasets from a different geographic locale.",
